The tables will be in csv from colaboratory, we will write the text in colaboratory and in authorea; some file manipulation will be through github with the web interface; we will create a collaborative data analysis and report writing environment where online and offline research will be possible, including pushing out the report in many different formats. This will also act as a quick primer on python. We will use python 3 for data analysis.</div><div></div><div></div>
